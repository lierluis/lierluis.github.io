ShopU is a mock e-commerce website that provides consumer-to-consumer sales
services exclusively to students attending San Francisco State University.

For this project, I was given the task of developing the aforementioned website
through a series of milestones from June to August 2016, in which I was part of
a simulated upcoming startup company comprised of six members, and my
professors acted as the company's CEO, CTO, VP of Marketing, and customers.

**Concepts:**
* Principles of software engineering and organizational teamwork
* Software development life cycle
    * Approaches: Agile methodology, Iterative and Incremental development,
    Prototyping
* User-centered design

**Milestones:**
1. Executive summary, use cases, data definitions, requirements specification,
competitive analysis, high-level system architecture
2. Requirement prioritization, UI mockups and storyboards, database schema,
UML diagrams, APIs, key risks, team organization, vertical prototype
3. Feedback on teamwork, coding practices, and horizontal prototype
4. Beta launch, usability and QA tests, code review
5. Team member contributions, key challenges, final demo and delivery

**Technologies:**
* LAMP stack (PHP, MySQL), HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Frameworks/Libraries: [MINI], Bootstrap, jQuery
* jQuery plugins: DataTables, jQuery Validation
* Tools: NetBeans, MySQL Workbench, PuTTY, AWS, Git
