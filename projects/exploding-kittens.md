title: "Exploding Kittens"

Exploding Kittens is an online turn-based card game developed using
the Ruby on Rails web framework, based on the [card game of the same
name](https://explodingkittens.com) published by The Oatmeal.

Working on the front-end of the application, this was the first project I
had where I used web-based technologies. The project lasted from April to
June 2016.

**Concepts:**
* Web development
* Model-view-controller (MVC) architecture

**Technologies:**
* Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Frameworks/Libraries/Tools: Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, jQuery, Heroku
* Gems: PostgreSQL, Devise, Pusher

**Note:** The game was developed strictly for educational purposes. Seeing as
the real game's card images (assets) were used without permission, the
repository is set to private and the game is not hosted anywhere online.
