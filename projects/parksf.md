ParkSF is an Android mobile application that allows users to find and interact
with data on parking locations around downtown San Francisco, CA. Interactions
include saving, favoriting, and defining parking locations, as well as viewing
parking availability and crime statistics.

As part of my first team project at SFSU, I worked on the front-end of the
application, which meant working with the Android and Google Maps APIs. I
integrated the user interface with the APIs provided by the backend team, which
worked with the SFpark and SF Crimespotting APIs to retrieve data on parking
locations. From this project, I gained experience with working collaboratively
with others and using version control. The project lasted from February to May 2015.
