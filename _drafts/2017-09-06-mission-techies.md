Super late blog post!

I was a part of the Mission Techies program at the Mission Economic Development
Agency (MEDA) in San Francisco for about 2 months to prepare for a professional
career in the tech industry.

I learned many things not taught as part of my CS program at SFSU, such as
interpersonal and corporate skills to have in any job, as well as interview
skills, how to write a resume, etc. and made many connections and friendships
throughout my time there.

We were visited by many people with diverse backgrounds in the tech industry,
from entrepreneurs to IT support specialists to developers. We also took part
in site visits to tech companies in the Bay Area including LinkedIn, JonesIT,
and Twitter. Overall we learned a lot from the Q&As we received and got more
insight into what it's like to be working in the industry.

* Help with resume, LinkedIn profile
* Learned about personal branding, interpersonal communication
* At LinkedIn I learned that networking is the best way to get a job
  * 80% of jobs out there are actually only accessible through networking
    * Weak connections can go a long way
    * When you connect with people, you're much more likely to be recommended
    for a position.
* At Twitter I was a part of an experimental technical interview workshop along
with members of BAVC, where I learned about technical interviews and what
recruiters expect from candidates

Maybe I'll add more to this blog post later, but as for now it'll do.
