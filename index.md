I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for technology.

I recently graduated from San Francisco State University with a B.S. in Computer
Science, where I started with zero knowledge of programming and finished as tech
lead of my last team project.

I have about 4 years of programming experience and am currently looking for new
opportunities in the industry.
