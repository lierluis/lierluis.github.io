<p class="title">About me</p>

I'm a software engineer with a passion for technology and programming.

I recently graduated from San Francisco State University with a B.S. in Computer
Science, and have over 3 years of programming experience.

I also recently graduated from the Mission Techies program at MEDA where I
prepared for a professional career in the tech industry.

I'm currently looking for new opportunities to continue my career in software
development.
